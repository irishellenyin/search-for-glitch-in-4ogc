for the sake of searching speed, you need to download a bunch of files following [find_glitch.ipynb](https://github.com/irishellenyin/search-for-glitch-in-4ogc/blob/main/find_glitch.ipynb), and maybe do some adjustments.

however, you can choose to browse [results.pdf](https://github.com/irishellenyin/search-for-glitch-in-4ogc/blob/main/results.pdf) i collected for you, relaxed and smiling, and listen to Glitch by Taylor Swift:)
